This allows everyone to have an early view of what is being worked on and provide some code ideas of their own.  \r\n\r\nThis repo will often have bugs and changes in direction as we move things along, hence the name playpen suits it well","tagline":"Thoughts, Ideas and bits of code for SMF (2.1)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
